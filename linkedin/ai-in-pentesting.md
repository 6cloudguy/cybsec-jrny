**Instructor**: Tennisha Martin  
**Platform**: LinkedIn Learning 
**Completed**: July 2025

## 🔍 Course Highlights

- **Use of AI in Pentesting**:
  - AI models (like ChatGPT) can generate payloads, automate basic scripts, and even build recon tools
  - Prompts can guide enumeration steps, checklist generation, help user decide on what to do next, and even exploit building

- **Example Prompt**:
  - Create a python script that performs nmap and DIRB scans on a target machine and writes output in a file 
  - Based on these *(in context that u have provided the result of a recon/vuln scan)* vulnerabilities, provide well formatted commands that can be used to provide a PoC for each of these 

- **Real-World Tools**:
  - *HackingBuggyGPT*: An AI-powered recon and scripting assistant
  - Mention of how bug bounty hunters use AI for quick scripting and recon

- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Use AI responsibly
  - Validate any generated code before execution
  - Do not use in places where u dont have permisson

## 💭 Personal Takeaways

- I now understand that AI tools can greatly speed up pentesting tasks
- Planning to explore prompt-driven scripting with Python + ChatGPT
- Will try using ChatGPT to write a subdomain finder or a vulnerability finder as practice
