# Web Requests⛓️‍💥

## 📌 Module Overview:
The **Web Requests** module introduced me to how web clients and servers communicate through HTTP. It focused on analyzing and crafting requests to understand and manipulate web app behavior — a core skill in web penetration testing.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned:

### 📁 1. HTTP Methods:
I learned the primary HTTP request methods used in web communication:

- `GET`: Retrieve information from the server.
- `POST`: Send data to the server (e.g., form submissions).
- `PUT`: Update existing resources.
- `DELETE`: Remove resources.
- `OPTIONS`: Discover supported methods.
- `HEAD`: Same as GET, but returns only headers.

### 🔎 2. Request Structure:
Every HTTP request contains:

- **Method**: Action type (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
- **URL**: Target location on the server
- **Headers**: Meta-information like content type, cookies, etc.
- **Body (Optional)**: Data sent to the server (in POST/PUT requests)

### 📬 3. Important Headers:
I became familiar with common and useful headers like:

- `User-Agent`: Identifies the client (can be faked!)
- `Host`: Specifies domain for virtual hosting
- `Referer`: Page from which request originated (often used in CSRF validation)
- `Cookie`: Session tracking and authentication
- `Content-Type`: Defines format of request body (e.g., `application/json`)
- `Authorization`: Contains credentials for authentication (e.g., Basic, Bearer)

## 🧪 Practical Tools & Skills:

### 🐚 Using `curl`:
I practiced making manual requests using `curl` in the terminal. Some key commands:

- `curl http://target.com` – Basic GET request
- `curl -X POST -d "user=admin&pass=123" http://target.com/login` – POST data
- `curl -X DELETE http://target.com/resource/5` – DELETE request
- `curl -H "Authorization: Basic base64stuff==" http://target.com` – Add headers
- `curl -i http://target.com` – Show response headers

These helped me interact directly with the server and observe responses.

### 🛠️ Crafting Requests for Testing:
- Sending invalid or edge-case headers
- Testing different content types (`application/json`, `multipart/form-data`)
- Manipulating cookies and tokens
- Observing how different servers handle unexpected input

## 🧩 Security Relevance:

- **Testing input validation** using different methods (e.g., sending `DELETE` instead of `POST`)
- **Bypassing security filters** using custom headers or changing User-Agent
- **Detecting auth misconfigurations** via header manipulation
- **Cookie tampering** for privilege escalation or session hijacking
